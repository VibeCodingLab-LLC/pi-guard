# Pi Guard

**Hardened network security appliance for Raspberry Pi**

Turn a €15-40 Raspberry Pi into a 24/7 security appliance that blocks malware, encrypts DNS, detects intrusions, and alerts you on your phone.

---

## What Does Pi Guard Do?

1. **Blocks bad websites** - Stops ads, trackers, and malware domains (1M+ blocklist)
2. **Encrypts your DNS** - Your ISP can't see what websites you visit
3. **Detects attacks** - Intrusion detection with priority-based alerting
4. **Monitors your network** - Detects ARP spoofing and rogue devices
5. **Alerts you instantly** - Telegram/Discord/Email with retry logic

## Hardware Support

| Device | RAM | What Gets Installed | Best For |
|--------|-----|---------------------|----------|
| **Pi Zero W** | 512MB | Pi-hole + Unbound + fail2ban | DNS filtering only |
| **Pi 3A+** | 512MB | Above + Snort IDS + arpwatch | Full security stack |
| **Pi 3B+/4** | 1GB+ | Above + Pi.Alert + ntopng | Complete monitoring |

The installer **automatically detects your hardware** and installs appropriate components.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite to SD card (use Raspberry Pi Imager)
#    Enable SSH in settings, set hostname to "pi-guard"

# 2. Boot Pi and SSH in
ssh pi@pi-guard.local

# 3. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pi-guard.git
cd pi-guard
sudo bash scripts/install.sh

# 4. Follow the prompts
```

**Total time:** 30-60 minutes depending on hardware

## Security Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **DNS Filtering** | Pi-hole blocks ads, trackers, malware domains |
| **Encrypted DNS** | Unbound with DNS-over-TLS to Cloudflare |
| **Firewall** | iptables with rate limiting, deny-by-default |
| **SSH Hardening** | Key-only auth, fail2ban, restricted user group |
| **Intrusion Detection** | Snort 3 with tuned rules (Pi 3A+ only) |
| **ARP Monitoring** | Detects MITM attacks and rogue devices |
| **Audit Logging** | Full system audit trail with auditd |
| **Memory Optimization** | zram for better performance on limited RAM |
